He is one of the most important theorists on the development of modern Western society.[7] His ideas profoundly influenced social theory and social research.[8] Weber is often cited, with \u00c9mile Durkheim and Karl Marx, as among the three founders of sociology.[9][10][11][12][13] Weber was a key proponent of methodological anti-positivism, arguing for the study of social action through interpretive (rather than purely empiricist) means, based on understanding the purpose and meaning that individuals attach to their own actions. Unlike Durkheim, he did not believe in monocausal explanations and rather proposed that for any outcome there can be multiple causes.[14]\nWeber's main intellectual concern was understanding the processes of rationalisation, secularisation, and \"disenchantment\", which he associated with the rise of capitalism and modernity.[15] He saw these as the result of a new way of thinking about the world.[16] Weber is best known for his thesis combining economic sociology and the sociology of religion, elaborated in his book The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, in which he proposed that ascetic Protestantism was one of the major \"elective affinities\" associated with the rise in the Western world of market-driven capitalism and the rational-legal nation-state. He argued that it was in the basic tenets of Protestantism to boost capitalism.

Sometimes called \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work.[2] Although the majority of the band's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \"Taxman\", \"Within You Without You\", \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", \"Here Comes the Sun\" and \"Something\".\nHarrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through his use of the sitar on \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\". Having initiated the band's embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. After the band's break-up in 1970, Harrison released the triple album All Things Must Pass, a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, \"My Sweet Lord\", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid.

In 1828 he took a leading role in the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts which discriminated against Protestant dissenters. In 1829 he was a leader in support of Catholic emancipation. He was a prominent leader in passing the Great Reform Act of 1832. It was the first major reform of the representative system in two centuries, and the first step on the road to democracy and away from rule by the aristocracy and landed gentry. He favoured reduction of the property qualifications to vote but never advocated universal suffrage. He served in many high offices over the decades, including home secretary and colonial Secretary under Melbourne; he was leader of the house under Aberdeen; he was foreign secretary under Aberdeen and Palmerston. He was outspoken on many issues, calling for the repeal of the corn laws in 1845, denouncing the revival of Catholic bishoprics in 1850, supporting Italian nationalism, and keeping the nation neutral during the American Civil War. In the 1860s he sympathized with the cause of Poland and Denmark, but took no action as prime minister. Over the years he was closely associated with Palmerston,  although there were stormy times as when he helped force Palmerston out as prime minister in 1851, and in revenge Palmerston defeated his government in 1852. Russell often acted before building a consensus among his leadership team. He mishandled the reform movement during the second premiership, and left office only to watch Disraeli carry a strong Reform Bill.[1]", "reference": 70, "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_John_Russell"}, {"name": "william james", "born": "(1842-01-11)January 11, 1842New York City, US", "died": "August 26, 1910(1910-08-26) (aged\u00a068)Tamworth, New Hampshire, US", "nationality": null, "pic_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/william_james#/media/File:William_James_b1842c.jpg", "desc": "Along with Charles Sanders Peirce, James established the philosophical school known as pragmatism, and is also cited as one of the founders of functional psychology.

Beyond this, artists like Domenico Ghirlandaio, Francesco Botticini, and Pietro Perugino were also involved and their early works can be hard to distinguish from works by Verrocchio.[5] Giovanni Santi records that Botticelli, Luca Signorelli, and a young Filippino Lippi also visited or worked in Verrocchio's studio.[6] Of the artist's pedagougery the Florentine poet Ugolino Verino wrote that.. \"Whatever painters have that is good they drank from Verrocchio\u2019s spring\"....[7]\nAt the end of his life, Verrocchio opened a new workshop in Venice, where he was working on the statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni, leaving the Florentine workshop in charge of Lorenzo di Credi.

His works have a broad popular appeal in the United States for their reflection of American culture. Rockwell is most famous for the cover illustrations of everyday life he created for The Saturday Evening Post magazine over nearly five decades.[1] Among the best-known of Rockwell's works are the Willie Gillis series, Rosie the Riveter, The Problem We All Live With, Saying Grace, and the Four Freedoms series. He is also noted for his 64-year relationship with the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), during which he produced covers for their publication Boys' Life, calendars, and other illustrations. These works include popular images that reflect the Scout Oath and Scout Law such as The Scoutmaster, A Scout is Reverent[2] and A Guiding Hand,[3] among many others.\nNorman Rockwell was a prolific artist, producing more than 4,000 original works in his lifetime. Most of his works are either in public collections, or have been destroyed in fire or other misfortunes. Rockwell was also commissioned to illustrate more than 40 books, including Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn as well as painting the portraits for Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon, as well as those of foreign figures, including Gamal Abdel Nasser and Jawaharlal Nehru. His portrait subjects included Judy Garland. One of his last portraits was of Colonel Sanders in 1973.

This painter worked around 575\u2013550 BC, and is best known for his work on Siana cups.[6] The Amasis Painter borrows scenes from the Heidelberg Painter, such as a warrior dressing himself in greaves with multiple bystanders; however, the Amasis Painter adds his own touch in the treatment of his figures, imparting a greater sense of detail, and often adding a signature double-band border and palmette-lotus festoon to the ornamental decoration.[7] In other examples, the Amasis Painter\u2019s use of fringed garments also emphasizes a possible close relationship between the two.[8]", "reference": 37, "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amasis_painter"}, {"name": "alexej von jawlensky", "born": "(1864-03-13)13 March 1864Torzhok, Tver Governorate, Russian Empire", "died": "15 March 1941(1941-03-15) (aged\u00a077)Wiesbaden, Germany", "nationality": "Russian", "pic_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/alexej_von_jawlensky#/media/File:Alexej_von_Jawlensky_Selbstbildnis_1905.jpg", "desc": "Alexej von Jawlensky was born in Torzhok, a town in Tver Governorate, Russia, as the fifth child of Georgi von Jawlensky and his wife Alexandra (n\u00e9e Medwedewa).

His artistic versatility was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival, the fellow Florentine, Leonardo da Vinci.[2] Several scholars have described Michelangelo as the greatest artist of his age and even as the greatest artist of all time.[3][4]\nA number of Michelangelo's works of painting, sculpture and architecture rank among the most famous in existence.[2] His output in these fields was prodigious; given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches and reminiscences, he is the best-documented artist of the 16th century. He sculpted two of his best-known works, the Piet\u00e0 and David, before the age of thirty. Despite holding a low opinion of painting, he also created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and The Last Judgment on its altar wall. His design of the Laurentian Library pioneered Mannerist architecture.[5] At the age of 74, he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the Younger as the architect of St. Peter's Basilica.

In Rome he met Joshua Reynolds who was, at the time, producing a number of Caricature groups. Initially he worked for Joseph Vernet, creating landscapes of Tivoli and pastiches of Vernet's work.[3] In 1755 he was banished from Rome by the Tribunale della Santa Inquisizione, apparently for homosexual indiscretion.[1][4][5][6]  He fled to Florence where he remained for the rest of his life. He was assisted by his friendship with Sir Horace Mann, who was the British envoy and a point of contact with British tourists arriving in Florence.[7][8] In Florence he completed a detailed study of human physiognomy which, to his great sadness, was stolen and burnt. Despite this there remains some evidence of his work in this field. In 1768 and 1769 he speedily produced a number of prints, some of which have been used to identify some of the figures in the twenty or so painted caricature groups he produced during the 1760s and early 1770s.

Letters from John Singleton, Mrs. Copley's father, are in the Copley-Pelham collection.

He died there in 1737.\"[7] No contemporary evidence has been located for either year.\nExcept for a family tradition that speaks of his precocity in drawing, nothing is known of Copley's schooling or of the other activities of his boyhood.

It is certain that the widow Copley was married to Peter Pelham on May 22, 1748, and that at about that time she transferred her tobacco business to his house in Lindall Street (a quieter, more respectable part of town), at which the evening school also continued its sessions. In such a household young Copley may have learned to use the paintbrush and the engraver's tools. Whitmore says plausibly: \"Copley at the age of fifteen was able to engrave in mezzotint; his stepfather Pelham, with whom he lived three years, was an excellent engraver and skillful also with the brush.\"[8] The family lived next to the house occupied by japanner Thomas Johnston and his family, and Copley became friends with Thomas's son William, later to become a painter himself.[9]", "reference": 48, "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Singleton_Copley"}, {"name": "matthew west", "born": "Background information", "died": null, "nationality": null, "pic_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matthew_west#/media/File:Matthew_West_Live_at_the_Grand_Ole_Opry_December_13,_2012.jpg", "desc": "Matthew Joseph West[1] (born April 25, 1977) is an American contemporary Christian musician, singer-songwriter, and actor.

A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Gustav Klimt, Schiele was a major figurative painter of the early 20th century.

When he was 11\u00a0years old, Schiele moved to the nearby city of Krems (and later to Klosterneuburg) to attend secondary school. To those around him, Schiele was regarded as a strange child.

He also displayed incestuous tendencies towards his younger sister Gertrude (who was known as Gerti), and his father, well aware of Egon's behaviour, was once forced to break down the door of a locked room that Egon and Gerti were in to see what they were doing (only to discover that they were developing a film).

Sohrab Sepehri was very talented in fine arts and his paintings were displayed in many European exhibits. He is one of Iran's foremost modernist painters. Unfortunately, Sohrab suffered from leukaemia which terminated his short but rich life on 28 April 1980. Sohrab never got married, his grave in Kashan is frequently visited by many art lovers.[4][5]\nWell-versed in Buddhism, mysticism and Western traditions, he blended the Eastern concepts with Western techniques, thereby creating a kind of poetry unsurpassed in the history of Persian literature. To him, new forms were new means to express his thoughts and feelings. In one of his works called 'Footsteps of Water' or \u2018The Water\u2019s Footfall\u2019, Sepehri introduces himself, his family and his way of thinking in a poetic form. This poem which is written like a biography, has two aspects: the inner and outer. The Inner aspect of this poem is about God's recognition through the beauty of nature. Sepehri beautifully explains that he doesn't blindly do his religious duties. In most of his poems, Sepehri introduces a new form of literature by using romanticism and symbolism. The beauty of his poems is seen through his inspiration of nature and the use of tender and simple language. Abdolali Dastgheib, acclaimed literary critic writer, believes that Sepehri has reached great levels in poetic language following the publication of his later books such as \u2018The Water\u2019s Footfall\u2019, \u2018Traveler\u2019 and \u2018The Green Volume\u2019. He has used a special symbolism in these poems that makes the objects talk to the reader, rather than explaining those objects.[6] \nSepehri's poetry is full of humanity and concern for human values. His poetry has been translated into many languages including English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Swedish, Arabic, Turkish and Russian.

The settlement placed Henry in his grandmother's care, although he continued to see his father in London.[3] In 1725, Henry tried to abduct his cousin, Sarah Andrews, while she was on her way to church. He fled to avoid prosecution.[4] In 1728, he travelled to Leiden to study classics and law at the university.[2] However, lack of money obliged him to return to London and he began writing for the theatre. Some of his work was savagely critical of the government of Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole.\nThe Theatrical Licensing Act of 1737 is said to be a direct response to his activities in writing for the theatre.[2][5] Although the play that triggered the act was the unproduced, anonymously authored The Golden Rump, Fielding's dramatic satires had set the tone. Once it was passed, political satire on the stage became virtually impossible. Fielding retired from the theatre and resumed his career in law to support his wife Charlotte Craddock and two children by becoming a barrister.[2][5]", "reference": 22, "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fielding"}, {"name": " airstream", "born": "Product typeTravel trailers", "died": null, "nationality": null, "pic_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/_airstream#/media/File:AirstreamTrailer.jpg", "desc": "Airstream trailers and recreational vehicles are manufactured in Jackson Center, Ohio, USA.

In 1936, Byam introduced the \"Airstream Clipper\", which was essentially a rebadged 1935 Bowlus Road Chief, with the door relocated from the front to the side. The design cut down on wind resistance and thus improved fuel efficiency. It was the first of the now familiar sausage-shaped, silver aluminum Airstream trailers. The first Airstream, called the \"Clipper\" in 1936, was named after the first trans-Atlantic seaplane. It slept four, carried its own water supply, was fitted with electric lights and cost $1,200.[2] Of more than 400 travel trailer builders operating in 1936, Airstream was the sole survivor of the Depression.[3] During World War II, travel became a luxury most could not afford and non-military industries faced an acute aluminum shortage.

Her work is based in conceptual art and shows some attributes of feminism, minimalism, surrealism, Art Brut, pop art, and abstract expressionism, and is infused with autobiographical, psychological, and sexual content. She has been acknowledged as one of the most important living artists to come out of Japan.[1]\nKusama was raised in Matsumoto, and trained at the Kyoto School of Arts and Crafts in a traditional Japanese painting style called nihonga.[2] Kusama was inspired, however, by American Abstract impressionism. She moved to New York City in 1958 and was a part of the New York avant-garde scene throughout the 1960s, especially in the pop-art movement.[3] Embracing the rise of the hippie counterculture of the late 1960s, she came to public attention when she organized a series of happenings in which naked participants were painted with brightly colored polka dots.[4][5] Since the 1970s, Kusama has continued to create art, most notably installations in various museums around the world.[6]", "reference": 109, "wiki_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kusama_yayoi"}, {"name": "piero della francesca", "born": "c.\u20091415[1]Sansepolcro, Republic of Florence", "died": "12 October 1492(1492-10-12) (aged\u00a076\u201377)Sansepolcro, Republic of Florence", "nationality": "Italian", "pic_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/piero_della_francesca#/media/File:Vasari_-_Piero_della_Francesca.jpg", "desc": "Piero was born Piero di Benedetto in the town of Borgo Santo Sepolcro,[1][6] modern-day Tuscany, to Benedetto de' Franceschi, a tradesman, and Romana di Perino da Monterchi, members of the Florentine and Tuscan Franceschi noble family.

In 1439 Piero received, together with Domenico Veneziano, payments for his work on frescoes for the church of Sant'Egidio in Florence, now lost. In Florence he must have met leading masters like Fra Angelico, Luca della Robbia, Donatello, and Brunelleschi. The classicism of Masaccio's frescoes and his majestic figures in the Santa Maria del Carmine were for him an important source of inspiration.
